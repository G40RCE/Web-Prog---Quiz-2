            <p>Hi, I am James Matthew Ngo Avanceǹa, my nickname is Mat or James. I am a lover of gadgets, a digital tool enthusiast. I am techy and I love computer. I love playing video games. I love helping my brother and mom in doing household chores. As a person, I love working quietly with my computer and watching movies especially on Friday night or weekend. I am a pasta lover and pizza eater in case you want to treat me. 

            I want to be the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs; thus, I take my studies seriously. I am sometimes timid and nervous thus, I don’t talk to much, but I smile a lot. I am an advocate of health and wellness, not just because my mom is a medical practitioner but I am a firm believer of prevention, and believe in the importance of exercise, proper diet, and stress management, so that we will stay fit and healthy and be successful in our work.
                
            30 years from now, I will own my dream company and would see myself as a successful computer IT and a successful businessman, I would want to make it known that I am who I am because of my Alma Mater.
